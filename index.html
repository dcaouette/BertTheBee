<title>Bert The Bee Game</title>
<h2>What's Bert the Bee?</h2>
Bert the Bee is a 2D platformer game that was developed to be entered in Playtonic Games' #PickMePhoebee contest. 
    The game started development on the day the competition was announced on June 17th, 2019. This game was written from the ground up
using Typescript and was not aided by the use of external libraries or preexisiting engines. I did my best to include multiple gameplay elements and mechanics however, due to the short period of time I was unable to design multiple levels.

<h4>What's the story of the game?</h4>
<p>Bert the Bee was the most skilled guard of the Royal Beettalion. When Capital B captured Bert, he assigned Dr. Quack to develop an Impossible Lair and use Bert to test it's impossibility. Capital B figured if Bert couldn't escape Quack's newly developed lair, then it must be impossible. Bert must make his way through the "impossible" lair and attempt to take down Capital B and Dr. Quack.</p>

<h1>Warning!</h1>
This game contains programmer art and lacks audio. This game has only been tested on Google Chrome.<br>

Bert the bee is supposed to look like this however, I did not finish the animations so he has be swapped out for a bee themed square.

<h4>How to play:</h4>
<ul>
        <li><b>Left and right arrow keys</b> to move left and right.</li>
        <li><b>Up arrow key</b> to jump.</li>
        <li><b>Down arrow key</b> will display UI and fast fall when swimming.</li>
        <li>Hold down the <b>S key</b> to 'run' or increase movement speed.</li>
    </ul>
